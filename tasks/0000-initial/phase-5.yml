title: Daily Summaries, Advanced Features, and Final Polish
goal: Implement automated daily event summaries, enhance query capabilities for
  more complex searches, and ensure the bot is robust and production-ready
  through comprehensive error handling, logging, prompt optimization, and
  documentation.
details: This phase focuses on adding proactive features like daily summaries,
  improving user experience with more sophisticated querying, and hardening the
  application. It also includes final touches like prompt refinement and
  ensuring the project is well-documented.
tasks:
  - title: Implement Daily Summary Feature
    description: Create a scheduled job (e.g., using `node-cron`) that runs daily at
      a configurable time (respecting the configured timezone). This job will
      fetch all events (non-recurring and the next occurrences of recurring
      ones) for the current day, format them into a clear summary, and post this
      summary to a designated Discord channel. After processing, it will update
      the `next_occurrence` for recurring events that were included in the
      summary.

  - title: Develop Advanced Querying Capabilities
    description: Enhance the LLM query analysis and database retrieval logic to
      support more complex queries. This includes person-based queries ("What's
      up with Sarah?"), category-based fact queries ("What allergies do we
      know?"), and combined keyword searches across various fields in both facts
      and events.

  - title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
    description: "Integrate robust error handling throughout the application: for
      user input validation (clarifying ambiguous dates/info), database
      operations (using transactions where appropriate), LLM API calls (retries,
      fallbacks), and Discord connectivity issues. Implement structured logging
      for key events, errors, and diagnostics to facilitate monitoring and
      debugging."

    steps: []
  - title: Final Review, Documentation, and Polish
    description: Conduct a thorough review of all features, refine LLM prompts for
      optimal performance and accuracy, update and finalize project
      documentation (including README.md and any necessary user guides), and
      perform final testing to ensure overall quality and stability.
