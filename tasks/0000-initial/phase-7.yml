title: Advanced Queries, Update Management, and Conflict Resolution
goal: Implement the full suite of advanced query capabilities, robust data
  update management including full history tracking for rollbacks, and basic
  conflict resolution.
details: This phase rounds out the core interaction features by adding more
  sophisticated ways to query data and manage it over time. It also introduces
  mechanisms for data integrity like user-initiated rollbacks and handling
  conflicting information.
tasks:
  - title: Person-Centric Queries
    description: Implement functionality to respond to queries like "Tell me
      everything about David" or "What's coming up for Mom?". This will involve
      fetching and combining relevant facts and events for a specific person.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Category-Based Queries
    description: Enable users to query for facts or events based on categories, such
      as "List all the passwords," "What medical information do we have for
      Sarah?", or "Show me all recurring events."
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Keyword Searches
    description: Implement a general keyword search capability that allows users to
      find facts or events containing specific keywords (e.g., "Anything about
      the dentist?", "Find everything with 'school'").
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Full History Tracking and Snapshots Consolidation
    description: Ensure that the `fact_history` and `event_history` tables
      comprehensively capture before/after JSON snapshots for all create,
      update, and delete operations, providing a complete audit trail.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: User-Initiated Rollback Capability
    description: Implement a mechanism allowing users to roll back specific changes
      made to facts or events, based on the recorded history (e.g., "Undo the
      last change to Sarah's allergies"). This will require careful design to
      identify the correct historical record and revert the data.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Basic Intelligent Conflict Resolution
    description: Implement logic for the bot to identify potential conflicts when
      storing or updating information (e.g., scheduling a new event that
      overlaps with an existing one for the same person). The bot should prompt
      the user for confirmation or clarification in such cases.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Smart Merging of Partial Information
    description: Refine how partial updates (from Phase 6) are merged with existing
      data, potentially using the LLM to help understand the intent and ensure
      data consistency, especially for complex records.

project:
  goal: To create a natural language Discord bot that serves as a personal
    information manager, storing and retrieving time-based events and general
    facts, using an LLM-powered conversational interface.
  title: Personal Assistant Discord Bot Development Plan
  details: The project involves building a Discord bot using Bun, SQLite,
    Discord.js, and the Vercel AI SDK with Gemini Flash 2.5. The bot will manage
    events (one-time, recurring, all-day) and facts (attributes, relationships,
    credentials, preferences, contacts). Key features include natural language
    understanding for input, queries, corrections, and deletions; intelligent
    processing like automatic information extraction and smart assumptions;
    comprehensive query capabilities; flexible update mechanisms; and automated
    features like a daily summary. The initial version will support a single
    user.
