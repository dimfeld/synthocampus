title: Automated Features, Performance, and Finalization
goal: Add automated features like the daily summary, optimize system
  performance, conduct thorough testing, and finalize documentation for the bot.
details: This final phase focuses on proactive features, ensuring the bot is
  efficient and robust, and preparing it for reliable use. It includes
  implementing the daily summary, performance tuning, comprehensive error
  handling, and final documentation.
tasks:
  - title: Daily Summary Implementation
    description: Create a scheduled task (e.g., using a cron-like mechanism suitable
      for the Bun environment) that automatically generates a summary of all
      events for the current day. This summary should be chronologically
      organized and posted directly to a designated Discord channel at 7:00 AM
      Hawaii time.

  - title: Recurring Event Management Enhancements
    description: Review and refine the recurring event generation logic,
      particularly for more complex patterns (e.g., "every other week," "last
      Friday of the month"). Consider adding holiday awareness for business day
      calculations if deemed critical and feasible within scope.

  - title: Performance Optimization Review
    description: >
      Review and implement performance optimizations:
          *   Verify and add database indexes for common query patterns (person, date ranges, categories, keywords).
          *   Ensure consistent use of prepared statements for all SQL queries to prevent SQL injection and improve performance.
          *   Evaluate the need for and potentially implement query result caching for frequently accessed, non-volatile data.

  - title: Advanced Error Handling and LLM Fallbacks
    description: Implement comprehensive error handling for LLM API interactions
      (including retries, timeouts, and fallback strategies for when the LLM is
      unavailable or returns unexpected results) and database operations. Ensure
      user-friendly error messages are provided.

    steps: []
  - title: Refine LLM Prompts and Function Calling
    description: Conduct a thorough review and iteration cycle on all LLM system
      prompts and function calling definitions. Fine-tune them for improved
      accuracy, efficiency, token usage, and robustness based on extensive
      testing of various conversational flows.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Comprehensive End-to-End Testing
    description: Perform thorough testing of all features, including edge cases,
      complex conversational flows, data validation, error handling, and the
      daily summary feature. Test across different types of inputs and queries.
    files: []
    steps: []
  - title: Documentation Finalization
    description: Update and finalize the `README.md` file and any other relevant
      documentation. Include complete setup instructions, detailed usage
      examples for all major features, an overview of the bot's capabilities,
      and a brief summary of the technical architecture.

project:
  goal: To create a natural language Discord bot that serves as a personal
    information manager, storing and retrieving time-based events and general
    facts, using an LLM-powered conversational interface.
  title: Personal Assistant Discord Bot Development Plan
  details: The project involves building a Discord bot using Bun, SQLite,
    Discord.js, and the Vercel AI SDK with Gemini Flash 2.5. The bot will manage
    events (one-time, recurring, all-day) and facts (attributes, relationships,
    credentials, preferences, contacts). Key features include natural language
    understanding for input, queries, corrections, and deletions; intelligent
    processing like automatic information extraction and smart assumptions;
    comprehensive query capabilities; flexible update mechanisms; and automated
    features like a daily summary. The initial version will support a single
    user.
