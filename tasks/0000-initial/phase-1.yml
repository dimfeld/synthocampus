title: Core Infrastructure and Basic Connectivity
goal: Establish the foundational elements of the project, including project
  setup, basic Discord bot functionality, database integration, and LLM
  connectivity.
details: This phase ensures all core systems are in place and communicating,
  forming the backbone for subsequent feature development. It covers setting up
  the development environment, connecting to Discord, initializing the database
  with its schema, and establishing a connection to the LLM service.
tasks:
  - title: Initialize Project and Basic Discord Bot
    description: Set up the Bun/TypeScript project, configure necessary tooling
      (linters, TypeScript), create a Discord bot application, and establish a
      basic connection where the bot comes online in a server. This includes
      implementing a robust system for managing environment variables (e.g., bot
      token, API keys).

  - title: Database Setup and Initial Schema
    description: Integrate SQLite into the project using a suitable driver for
      Bun/Node.js. Define the complete database schema as per the project
      specifications, including tables for `events`, `facts`,
      `recurring_patterns`, `event_history`, and `fact_history`. Create an
      idempotent migration script to initialize the database and its tables.

  - title: LLM Integration Setup
    description: Integrate the Vercel AI SDK with Google Gemini (or the specified
      LLM). Configure API key access securely using environment variables.
      Create a basic module or service that initializes the LLM client and
      provides a simple function to test sending a prompt and receiving a
      response from the LLM.
